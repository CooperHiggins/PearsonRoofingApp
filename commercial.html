The size of your roof and weather conditions factor into the amount of time for completion, but we own our dump trucks and waste is removed from the job site immediately which cuts down on construction time dramatically.</p>

                        <p class="text-muted">You have the privilege of choosing the roofing company in whom you have the most confidence. Even if you get recommendations from various sources, it is your responsibility to research the companies. You do not have to go with the lowest bid, which is what your insurance company would like you to believe. Remember, an inexpensive roof is no bargain if you have problems, especially if your contractor is no longer around to honor the labor warranty. Be sure the company you choose is reputable, and local. Contact the Better Business Bureau to find out how long they have been in business. The contractor you choose should have at least ten years experience locally. </p>

                        <p class="text-muted">On residential re-roofing projects, payment is due in full upon substantial completion of the roof. If you are dealing with an insurance claim, we ask for the first check as soon as you receive it. Your Pearson Roofing representative will invoice your insurance company for the remainder of the roof upon completion. Insurance companies will release the second portion as soon as the roof is completed and they have received an invoice. Final payment is due when you receive your second check. This is usually about seven to ten business days from the completion of your roof.</p>

You can check with your mortgage company before the job starts to find out what information they require to obtain endorsement, or you can sign a homeowner’s affidavit and let Pearson Roofing take care of everything for you. We are very experienced in mortgage company procedures, and in most cases we already have the information needed because we have worked with your company in the past.</p>
